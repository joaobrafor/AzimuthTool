name=AzimuthTool
description=A powerful QGIS plugin for generating vector line layers from azimuths or quadrant bearings and distances, starting from a user-defined point.
about=AzimuthTool simplifies the creation of line geometries in QGIS by allowing users to input an initial coordinate, followed by angles (azimuths like "90-30-15.50" or bearings like "45-15-30-NE") and distances (e.g., "100.25"). It supports flexible workflows with features like snapping to existing layers, importing/exporting data via text files, and outputting results as shapefiles, geopackages, or temporary layers.
